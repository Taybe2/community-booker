## Manual Testing

## Automated Testing

## Validation Testing
Validation checks for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python

### HTML Validation
- **Tool Used:** W3C Validator.
- **Results:**
  
  - **Homepage:** Passed with no errors or warnings.
  
  - **Available Time Slots Page:**
    - **Issue Identified:** 
      The input elements with type="radio" had an unnecessary role="radio", which caused accessibility warnings.
    - **Resolution:**  
      Removed the role="radio" attribute from the input elements, which resolved all accessibility issues for this page.
  
  - **Redirect to Login After Attempting to Book a Time Slot Without Logging In:**
    - **No errors or warnings reported.**
    - **Info Message Observed:**
      *"Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values."*
    - **Analysis:**
      The message refers to the `<input>` element rendered by Django with a trailing slash (`<input ... />`). This is XHTML-compatible but unnecessary in HTML5. It doesn't impact the functionality or user experience.
    - **Action Taken:**
      No changes were made since the behavior is generated by Django's built-in templates, and the info message does not indicate a defect.
  
  - **Confirm Booking Page:**
    - **No errors or warnings reported.**
