# Testing Documentation

This document outlines the testing process for the Community Booker App, including manual testing, automated tests, and validation checks to ensure the application meets user and technical requirements.

## Manual Testing

## Automated Testing

## Validation Testing
Validation checks for HTML, CSS and Python

### HTML Validation
- **Tool Used:** W3C Validator.
- **Results:**
  
  - **Homepage:** Passed with no errors or warnings.
  
  - **Available Time Slots Page:**
    - **Issue Identified:** 
      The input elements with type="radio" had an unnecessary role="radio", which caused accessibility warnings.
    - **Resolution:**  
      Removed the role="radio" attribute from the input elements, which resolved all accessibility issues for this page.
  
  - **Confirm Booking Page:**
    - **No errors or warnings reported.**
  
  - **My Bookings Page:**
    - **Issue Identified:** 
      1. **Error:** Bad value ``button`` for attribute type on element `a`: Subtype missing.
      2. **Error:** Element `a` is missing required attribute href.
      3. **Error:** The ``aria-controls`` attribute must point to an element in the same document.
      4. **Warning:**  Empty heading.
    - **Resolution:**  
      1. To resolve the error, I removed the ``type="button"`` attribute from the anchor tag. If a button element is needed for behavior, it should be used instead of an anchor tag.
      2. To fix this error, I added a ``href="#"`` attribute to the anchor tag, because the link was intended for JavaScript functionality.  This placeholder ensures the anchor tag is valid while still performing the desired JavaScript action.
      3. To resolve this, I added the appropriate element IDs to ensure that the ``aria-controls`` attribute references an existing element within the same document.
      4. To resolve the warning, I added a heading with text content. Additionally, if dynamic content needs to be added to the heading, I used JavaScript to append the remainder of the content to the heading.
  
  - **Edit Booking Page:**
    - **Issue Identified:** 
      Error: Bad value submit for attribute type on element a: Subtype missing
    - **Resolution:**  
      To resolve the error, I removed the ``type="submit"`` attribute from the ``<a>`` tag, as anchor elements do not support the type attribute. If the element was intended to behave like a submit button, it should be replaced with a ``<button>`` tag instead.

  - **Log Out Page:**
    - **No errors or warnings reported.**
  
  - **Log In Page:**
    - **No errors or warnings reported.**
  

  - **Register Page:**
    - Observed unclosed HTML tags in the template generated by Django Allauth.
    - Root Cause: The default Allauth templates use unclosed tags.
    - Resolution: Documented the issue but deferred fixing due to time constraints. Will address in future.


### CSS Validation
- **Tool Used:** W3C CSS Validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- **Results:**
  - **Stylesheet:** styles.css
  - **Outcome:** No errors. Warning regarding same color for `background-color` and `border-color` in the `.btn-check:checked + .btn-timeslot` selector.
- **Actions Taken:** Replaced the `border-color` with `transparent` to avoid having the same color for both properties.

### PEP8 Compliance Check

### PEP8 Compliance Check

**Objective:**  
To ensure that the Python code adheres to the PEP8 style guide, which promotes readability and consistency in Python code.

**Method:**  
I manually checked all Python files in the project using the CI Python Linter. The linter flagged any deviations from PEP8 standards, such as improper indentation, excessive line length, missing/extra whitespace.

**Actions Taken:**  
- Reviewed each Python file individually through the CI Python Linter.
- Corrected all flagged issues, including:
  - Lines exceeding 79 characters.
  - Missing or extra whitespace.
  - Improper indentation.
  - Any other PEP8-related errors or warnings.

**Result:**  
After manually checking and fixing all files, the Python code now complies with PEP8 standards as verified by the CI Python Linter.
